# Pyodide Python package

A Python package providing core interpreter functionality for Pyodide.

This package is an integral part of the Pyodide runtime which cannot start
without it. Install in a native Python for type checking or testing purposes.
Some of the functionality is missing when imported in a native Python, but for
the APIs we either provide reimplementations or nonfunctional type stubs.

## Design information for Pyodide contributors

This directory consists of two Python packages py/\_pyodide and py/pyodide. The
difference between these packages is when they are imported. They are both
imported by core/pyodide as a part of setting up the Pyodide/javascript foreign
function interface.

py/\_pyodide is imported as the first step after initializing
the CPython interpreter. py/\_pyodide cannot have any import time dependencies
other than the CPython stdlib.

py/pyodide is imported as the final step of core/pyodide. It has an import time
dependency on `_pyodide_core` which is a Python C extension assembled by
core/pyodide to serve the needs of py/pyodide.
