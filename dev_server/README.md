# Dev server


Only needed if editing files locally, and you want auto reload.

The dev server will serve the site, and auto refresh when source code/sketches change. 

Sketch changes will only reload the sketch file. This makes iteratating much faster, since the sketch file can run much faster than reloading the entire site.
